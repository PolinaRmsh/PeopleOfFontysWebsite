## Fontys teacher and student web database and messenger

This is a project for the WEB1 module made by Polina Rymshina and Matei Voicu, of class E-S23. It aims to provide an easy way to contact teachers and students of Fontys, via instant messaging or via email, as well as letting you see a picture of them (if they have submitted it). 

### Features
