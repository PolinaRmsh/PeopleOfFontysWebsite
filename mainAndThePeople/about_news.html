        <h3>Feb 2018 - website creation kickoff</h3>
        <p>
            Now this is the story all about how
            My life got flipped, turned upside down
            And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
            I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air

            In west Philadelphia born and raised
            On the playground where I spent most of my days
            Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
            And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
            When a couple of guys, they were up to no good
            Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
            I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
            And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air"
